# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Celestial Warfare

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An arcade game where a rocket is shooting enemy objects

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

It will give an 2d shooting experience.It will be made with pygame.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Fahim Muntasir
email- fahim.muntasir@temple.edu
TA - Kora Sen

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
I'll learn how to make a project using what I have learned in class, and also understand how to use Python for something outside of regular classwork.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?


If I had more time, I would have done a bigger project, but I will still try to make my project as good as I can within the time I have and learn how to finish my programming work on time.



### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The game will run properly and be interesting enough for others to enjoy playing it.



## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to learn more about Pygame, especially how to add animations, sound, and make things like shooting and collisions work. I will also practice writing cleaner code using functions. Fahim will work on the rocket and shooting part, and I will handle enemy movement and the score system. We will share ideas, test the game together, and meet often to stay on track. It is our first time making a game, so we are excited to learn and create something fun!
